- Very nice presentation of what Swift Generics are, why theyâ€™re better than just defining something as `Any` (both from code, memory, and compiler perspective)
- How to create extensions only to some subsets of Generics
(see the `where ...`)
![][genericExtensionImage]
- How to add constraints to Generics `typealias`:
![][typealiasImage]
- How to use Generics in protocols (via `associatedtype`)
  - You can add constraints on the associatedtype:
  ![][associatedtypeImage]
  - Protocol Inheritance
  ![][ineritance1Image]
  ![][ineritance2Image]

- Protocol Conformance
