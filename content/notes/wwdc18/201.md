- Use Formatters
- Use storyboards with auto layout
- Use `UIStackViews` and `UICollectionViews` as much as possible
- When designing constraints, think about:
  - text that can be much shorter/longer
  - Directionality (right to left languages)

- After opening a `.storyboard` file, open the assistant editor (`cmd`+`opt`+`enter`), select the `storyboard (preview)` option and now at the bottom right you can preview your view in different languages without the need to run the app:

- How to check if a font supports a certain language? In every mac there‚Äôs a tool called `Font Book` where you can search by language and it displays all the (installed) fonts that support that language.

- Very much like on `.css` files, even on iOS/macOS you can define a Cascade List to revert to different fonts in case one language is not supported by the current selected font (if you don‚Äôt declare a cascade list, iOS will always fall back to the system font):

```swift
// Custom Font with Cascade List 

guard let font = UIFont (name: "SignPainter-HouseScript", size: UIFont.labelFontSize) else { 
  // Handle error
}

// Create Cascade List 
let cascadeList = [UIFontDescriptor(fontAttributes: [.name: "HanziPenTC-W5"])] 
let cascadedFontDescriptor = font.fontDescriptor.addingAttributes([.cascadelist: cascadeList])
let cascadedFont = UIFont(descriptor: cascadedFontDescriptor, size: font. pointSize)

// Handle Text Size (Dynamic Type)
label.font = UIFontMetrics.default.scaledFont(for: cascadedFont)
label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true 
```

- macOS Mojave has a new ‚Äúword-of-the-day‚Äù screensaver

- For word emphasis, do not use italics, it doesn‚Äôt work in most of the languages, and if you use numbers, those will be the only thing italicized in your text üëéüèª. Bold is a better alternative.

- For character emphasis, use different colors (bold doesn‚Äôt work for structural languages such as Hindi and Korean), use `AttributedStrings`.
