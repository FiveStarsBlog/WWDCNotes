## Questions to ask when creating a new View

- What data does this view need? 
- How will the view manipulate that data? Is it read only?
- Where will the data come from? To determine the source of truth

## Why do we need to use property wrappers to store our data?

Our views only exist temporarily: after SwiftUI completes their rendering, the structs instances go away.
When we add a property wrapper such as `@State` to our model, SwiftUI takes over managing its storage, making sure it's there even when our structs are re-created over and over.

## When to use what, for view-only sources of truth

### Swift Properties

- Use properties for data that is not mutated by the view (a.k.a. data that the view only reads, but not mutates).

### `@State`

- Use `State` for transient data owned by the view.
- By using `@State`, we're saying that the source of truth belongs to this View (a.k.a. it's local to this view). 

### `@Binding`

- Use `@Binding` for reading and mutating data owned by an ancestor. 
- `@Binding` creates a data dependency between our view and the ancestor owning that source of truth.
- It's ok to build a new binding from an existing binding. 

## `ObservableObject`

- Classes conforming to `ObservableObject` automatically gain a publisher, however we can write our own, for example we can use a publisher for a timer, or use a KVO publisher to observe an existing model.
- When our type conforms to `ObservableObject`, we're creating a new Source of Truth and teaching SwiftUI how to react to changes.
- We can think of `ObservableObject` as our interface to the real UI-independent data/model. 
- `ObservableObject` represents the part of our model/data that exposes data to our view, but it is not necessarily the full data/model.

## `@Published`

- Use `@Published` in the `@ObservableObject` properties that we want SwiftUI to be notified on change.

## When to use what, for `ObservableObject`

### `ObservedObject`

- Use `ObservedObject` when the source of truth is separate from its UI.

### `StateObject`

### `EnvironmentObject`
