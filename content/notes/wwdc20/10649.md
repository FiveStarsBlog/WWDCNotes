## Add custom views and modifiers to xcode library

### Recap

Start from Xcode 12, it lets you to add custom SwiftUI views and modifiers to the xcode library
Benefit of xcode library :
* Discoverability
* Learning
* Visual Editing

#### APIs Xcode Library

How to extend the Xcode library we need to use @LibraryContentBuilder property wrapper. The protocol `LibraryContentProvider` below will returns an array of library item.

```swift
public protocol LibraryContentProvider {
    @LibraryContentProvider
    var views: [LibraryItem] { get }
    
    @LibraryContentProvider
    func modifiers(base: ModifierBase) -> [LibraryItem]
}
```

Xcode library is very helpful for adding some view that being reusable in everywhere, look at this code below that conform to above protocol

```swift
struct LibraryContent: LibraryContentProvider {
    @LibraryContentProvider
    var views: [LibraryItem] { 
        LibraryItem (
            SmoothieRowView(smoothie: .salak),
            category: .control
        )
    }
}
```

Now we can find above convenient reusable `SmoothieRowView` through the Xcode library

![][xcode_library]

There are more things to do, such as rich title in there and also be able to put a category either as a control or another type, you can also put a title alias and show as nearby popularity or not through `LibraryItem`

#### APIs Xcode Modifier

Another great thing, we can add a modifier as a convenient and fast way to identify each view. Look at these extension

```swift
extension Image {
    func resizedToFill(width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) -> some View {
        self 
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
            .frame(width: width, height: height)
    }
}
```

Then we can make a modifier that we can easily search and reuse using this method

```swift
@LibraryContentBuilder
func modifiers(base: Image) -> [LibraryItem] {
    LibraryItem (
        base.resizedToFill(width: 20, height: 20)
    )
}
```

Result :

![][xcode_modifier]

Now you can easily search the method name  in your xcode library
