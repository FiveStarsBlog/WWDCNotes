## Overview

![][overviewImage]

- Sirikit encompasses the Intents and Intents UI frameworks which you use to integrate your services with Siri, Shortcuts, and maps. 
- in iOS 14 you can use intents to add configuration and intelligence to widgets. 
- An Intents UI app extension displays custom UI in the Siri shortcuts or maps interface
- An Intents app extension receives user requests from surrogate and turns them into app specific actions such as sending the message

## In-app intent handling

- new in iOS 14
- when should you use it?
  - when the intent controlls media playback/workouts
  - when the intent affects the apps user interface live on screen
  - when the intent needs more memory (e.g. photo/video editing)

### How to adopt in-app intent handling

- make sure to support multiple windows
- when your app is launched in response to a Sirikit request, tt will be launched without any `UIScene` object connected to your app
- list all intents that you would like to handle inside of your application in the `Support intents` section of your apps target
- implement the `AppDelegate`'s [`application(_:handlerFor:)`][application(_:handlerFor:)]

## What's new in iOS 14

- Rich Disambiguation:
  - in iOS 13 we were able to provide a list of options in case of ambiguity
  - this year we can add an image and a subtitle for each option
  - we can tell siri to paginate our items (to present to the user)

- Dynamic Search for dynamic options
- Parameters can be mark configurable and resolvable separately. Siri and the Shortcuts app will not resolve parameters which are marked as unresolvable.

## Tips

- Custom intents deprecation
  - we can now mark intents as deprecated in the Xcode 12 inspector.
  - this will be shown in the shortcuts.app:
![][deprecImage]

-  
  - the action will be hidden when creating new shortcuts

- Custom classes names:
  - classes are generated for you when defining when custom intents, custom types, or custom enums
  - you can now specify your generated class nameÂ in the Xcode inspector of your intent
  - alternatively, you can specify a common class prefix used for all custom intense types and enums in the project document inspector of your target where the code generation needs to happen.s
