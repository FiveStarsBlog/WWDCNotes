## Design best practices

- Avoid fixed widths or frames
- Avoid fixed spacing between distant objects
- Allow multiple lines of wrapped text when it makes sense
- Do not place too many controls in a fixed space (e.g. four buttons side by side)

## Demo project

The [demo project][dwl] comes with a `ReadjustingStackView` which switches axis (horizontal -> vertical) when the optimal horizontal space, computed via [`systemLayoutSizeFitting()`][systemLayoutSizeFitting()], exceeds the available space.
