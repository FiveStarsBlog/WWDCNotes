## New Power and Performance API

- Two of the most important aspects of ensuring a great user experience are optimizing the power and performance impact of your applications. 
- Last year Xcode Organizer gained power and performance analytics, the same data is now part of the App Store Connect API

### Smart Insights

New built-in smart insights feature to identify your application's power and performance hotspots without any additional effort:

- returned as part of the API data
- flag important power and performance hotspots:
  - regressions
  - trends

## Overview

New REST API resources:

- Performance Power metrics (metrics and insights)
  - aggregated by unique metrics and devices (battery, launch, disk writes)
  - for your app's most recent versions (up to eight most recent versions) `GET /v1/apps/{id}/perfPowerMetrics`
  - per build `GET /v1/builds/{id}/perfPowerMetrics`

- Diagnostic signatures (these signatures are used to group common problems)
  - e.g. disk writes and more
  - top signatures per build `GET /v1/builds/{id}/diagnosticSignatures`
  - logs per signature (contains stack trees) `GET /v1/diagnosticSignatures/{id}/logs` 

## Demo

Sample codes to generate a token, as well as to get diagnostics data will be released with the API later this year (2020).
