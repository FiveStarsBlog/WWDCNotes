## XCTSkip Your Test

Conditional test execution are widely being used in testing. It is determined on runtime. If conditional test execution not satisfied then following test requirements will be happen:
* Unmet requirements
* Return early or fail
* Both are undesirable

### What's new ?
In Xcode 12 you can use `XCTSkip` for testing that require conditional test execution. It will give you 3 result :
* Pass
* Fail
* Skip

#### Examples

```swift
guard #available(iOS 13.4, *) else {
    throw XCTSkip("Pointer interaction tests can only run on iOS 13.4")
}
```

We can see above that we only able run the function on iOS 13.4. If the device running on lower OS then it will throw the `XCTSkip` and skip the test

Now look on code below we will put conditional testing that protect only testing for iPad device

```swift
try XCTSkipIf(UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom != .pad, "Pointer interaction tests are for iPad only")
```

How is the result once above code applied to the test ? Test will be marked as successful with gray color that indicate there is a skipped test and there will be an annotation to track the specified location on the code

![][test_1]

We also able to check the result from the **test navigator** and **test report**. Using test report we can see the reason, why and where is the location of the skipped test

How is it look like in CI ? Look at picture below

![][test_2]

In picture above, we can see from the information about the differences between skip and succeed test with more detailed information through the stack trace

#### APIs

There are 2 throwing function
* `XCTSkipIf` : Skip test if expression is trye
* `XCTSkipUnless` : Skip test if expression is false

Code example :

```swift

public func XCTSkipIf(_ expression: @autoclosure () throws -> Bool, _ message: @autoclosure () -> String? = nil, file: StaticString = #filePath, line: UInt = #line) throws

public func XCTSkipUnless(/* same parameters as XCTSkipIf */)

```

However test also can throw `XCTSkip` directly that working perfectly for guard statement

```swift

public struct XCTSkip: Error {

    public init(_ message: String? = nil, file: StaticString = #filePath, line: UInt = #line)

}
```

#### Conclusion

Some test particularly Integration Test maybe unable to execute under certain condition. We can use `XCTSkip` when a runtime condition prevents a test from running
