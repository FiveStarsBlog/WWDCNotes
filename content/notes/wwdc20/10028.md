## Meet Widget Kit

### Great Widget

* Glanceable : Projecting Content to mini screen (Widget are not mini apps)
* Relevant : Should be relevant with user situation either on morning noon or night or any situation, with helps of Smart Stack
* Personalized : Supporting as many size as possible, use intent for edit configuration

### Recap
* Smart Stack : Collection of widget that helps relevancy of widget
* WidgetKit API : New API for providing method that can be used for playing around WidgetKit
* Siri Shortcut

#### How widget works
![][widget_works]

* As you can see on the picture above, WidgetKit extensions basically are background extension that turn into view hierarchy in the timeline (Timeline allows views to be ready up front)
* Data can be refreshed from main app 
* Schedules update can be done right from the extension

#### Defining a widget

* Kind : Widget can support multiple kind of widgets, example single stock widget, list stock widget or detail stock widget under the same bundles
* Configuration : Two ways to defining configuration either **StaticConfiguration** or **IntentConfiguration**

![][static_configuration]

![][intent_configuration]

* supportedFamilies : Widget can support system, medium and large
* Placeholder : Widget placeholder UI as default content of the widget however it should be no user data and only queried on environment change

#### Creating glanceable experience

* Stateless UI
* Widgets are not mini apps
* No scrolling
* No videos or animated images
* Tap interaction easily and deep link into our app

#### Views, timelines and reloads

* Snapshot is where the system need quickly display a single entry
* Timeline are combinations view and date that return that tell us on what time the view should be shown
* `WKExtension` return an entry will take that information and serialized it into a disk
* Reload where the system to wake up an extension and ask new timeline to the device


```swift
public protocol TimelineProvider {
    associatedType Entry: TimelineEntry
    typealias Context = TimelineProviderContext

    func snapshot(with context: Self.Context, 
                    completion: @escaping (Self.Entry) -> ())

    func timeline(with context: Self.Context, 
                    completion: @escaping (Timeline<Self.Entry>) -> ())

}
```

* Entry : mainly a date
* Context: environment information
* Snapshot : system ask the single entry
* Timeline : system ask series of entry and attached reload policy

#### Reload policy

* atEnd : tell last entry of timeline is displayed to start scheduling update
* after(date: Date) : tell to scheduled an update after specified date
* Never : system wont independently update the entry, need WidgetKit Center Api to do that

#### Networking

* We can use URLSession to kick off a task and use batch request as well background session. Be careful with how much network request is needed


#### Personalization and Intelligence aspect of widget

* Driven by 2 major context Intents and Relevants
* Intents framework used with siri shortcut, etc
* Power of intents for dynamic options capability
* Intelligence importants for having multiple widgets into the stack base on the configuration using TimelineEntryRelevance with put weighting on score and duration of the particular entry
