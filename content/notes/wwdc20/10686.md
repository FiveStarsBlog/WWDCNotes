## Architecture: Intel vs. Mac

- Intel-based architecture is composed of several, separated components such as Multicore CPUs, Discrete GPUs, T2.
- Apple Silicon instead has all the components in a SoC (System on a Chip): building everything into one chip gives the system a shared memory architecture. 
- SoC CPU and GPU work in the same memory, and data can be shared efficiently, without need to copy data over a PCIe bus.
- By using Apple Silicon, new macs gain powerful components present on iDevices such as specialized video encoder and decoder, Neural Engine, Machine Learning Accelerators
- intel-based macs CPUs have multiple cores with similar performance (a.k.a. symmetric cores)
- Apple Silicon has multiple performance cores and other power efficient cores (a.k.a. Asymmetric cores architecture)

### AMP (Asymmetric MultiProcessing)

All cores support the same architectural set of features, and support the same software

### How to take advantage of the new architecture

All modern frameworks have been adopted to take advantage of the new architecture, there are no API changes specifically for Apple Silicon.

- Unified memory architecture: use `Metal`
- Video encoder and decoder: use `AVFoundation` and `VideoToolbox`
- Neural Engine: use `CoreML`
- Machine Learning Accelerators: use `CoreML`, `Accelerate`, `Compression`, `simd`
- Asymmetric multiprocessing: use `QoS` and `GCD`

## Security features

Apple Silicon brings all the iPhone/iPad/.. security features to macOS:

- [Write XOR execute (W^X)][JIT]
- Kernel Integrity Protection
- Pointer authentication
- Device isolation

### Write XOR execute (W^X)

- Memory pages cannot be both writable and executable at the same time.
- Use `pthread_jit_write_protect_np` for fast switching between RW and RX permissions
- Per-thread permission to support multi-threaded JITs

### Kernel Integrity Protection

- Apple Silicon has hardware support in the memory controller that enforces kernel immutability
- Once the kernel has been loaded into memory, Kernel Integrity Protection makes sure that Kernel pages cannot be modified, or new pages made executable

### Pointer authentication

- Pointer authentication guards against misuse of pointers and prevent memory attacks.
- Enabled for: Kernel, System applications, System services

### Device isolation

On Apple Silicon all devices use a separate [IOMMU][IOMMU], this restrict devices to memory they're only intended to (Intel macs have a shared memory for all devices)

## ApplicationsRosetta

Rosetta runs:

- macOS/Catalyst applications
- games
- Web browsers
- JIT compilers
- Metal directly on Apple GPU
- Core ML with Neural Engine

There are differences between processes running on a Intel- and Apple Silicon-based Macs:

- Memory pages sizes
- TSO memory ordering
- sleep time
- Floating point NaN, denormal handling

Rosetta will make sure that Intel-apps will see the architecture they expect
