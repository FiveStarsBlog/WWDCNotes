- iOS will suggest recent addresses in text fields intelligently, adopt `.textContentType = .fullStreetAddress` on `UITextView` and `UITextField` (works with other types, too)
- Instead of asking for contact access, consider using `CNContactPickerViewController` (needs no access)
- In iOS 14 contact information in the QuickType keyboard is suggested for quick input (no access needed)
- AutoFill comes to macOS Big Sur, too (didn't exist before) â€“ works just like in iOS, supports other password managers
