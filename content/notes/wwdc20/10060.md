## Siri intent Coverage:

- These are the most popular Siri interactions with voice (covering 90% of all utterances):

![][popularImage]

- The better your Siri support is, the more likely it is that people will make more complicated Siri requests.

## Vocabularies

- help Siri understand the user intent
- User vocabulary:
  - user/personalized items
  - shared with Siri via [`INVocabulary`][INVocabulary] API
  - the items order is by priority (put more important items first)

```swift
let vocabulary = INVocabulary.shared()
let playlistNames = NSOrderedSet(objects: "70s punk classics")
vocabulary.setVocabularyStrings(playlistNames, of: .mediaPlaylistTitle) 
```

-  
  - Here's how to set it:

```swift
// Set our playlist title in user vocabulary so we get the proper Siri intent
let vocabulary = INVocabulary.shared()
let playlistNames = NSOrderedSet(objects: "70s punk classics")
vocabulary.setVocabularyStrings(playlistNames, of: .mediaPlaylistTitle)
```

- [Global vocabulary][globalVocabulary]:
  - general static vocabulary
  - defined in `appIntentVocabulary.plist`
  - only include things that are particular to your app, don't include popular music or podcast entities, as those are generally already recognized by Siri as part of its NL model
  - example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

					<string>70s punk anthems</string>
				</dict>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## MPRemoteCommandCenter

- Use [`MPRemoteCommandCenter`][MPRemoteCommandCenter] to handle playback intents like "next track" and more (this is the same center used to respond playback actions in the lock screen)
- Siri reads the center's [`nowPlayingInfo`][nowPlayingInfo] to answer questions reguarding the current playing song (set properties such as `MPMediaItemPropertyTitle`, `MPMediaItemPropertyArtist`, `MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle`)
