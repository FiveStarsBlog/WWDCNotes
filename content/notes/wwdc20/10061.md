SiriKit Media Intents allow you to add a wide variety of natural language queries to your application e.g.: 

- `Play music on AppName`
- `Play BandName on AppName`
- `Play song SongName on AppName`
- etc

## New platforms

From this year, SiriKit Media Intents come to

- HomePod, for more check [developer.apple.com/siri](developer.apple.com/siri)
- Apple TV

## New features

### Compact UI

Like the rest of the system, now SiriKit Media Intents will be handled in the system compact UI when intents are handled outside the app.

### Alternatives Support

After handling a request, in the compact UI there could be a `Maybe You Wanted` button that shows alternative songs to play instead of the current one.

This is achieved by calling 

```swift
INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.successes(with: mediaItems)
```

instead of 

```swift
INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.success(with: mediaItems[0])
```

when receiving a [`resolveMediaItems(for:with:)`][resolveMediaItems(for:with:)] call, e.g.:

```swifr
func resolveMediaItems(
  for intent: INPlayMediaIntent, 
  with completion: @escaping ([INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult]) -> Void
) {
  let mediaSearch = intent.mediaSearch
  resolveMediaItems(for: mediaSearch) { optionalMediaItems in
    guard let mediaItems = optionalMediaItems else {
      return
    }
    completion(INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.successes(with: mediaItems))
  }
}
```

If the user taps on an alternative song, this will come to the app as a normal `INPlayMediaIntent`.

## Performance improvements

### In-app intent handling

- moves the intent handling in the app
- no need to launch your intents extension and your app to start a background audio session (just the app will suffice now)
- note that because it's launching the app this might result in a slower Siri response

### App prewarming

Currently the system will launch your app in the background for it to begin playback **after** handling a intent, with app prewarming the system will launch the app in the background along with the intent extension (therefore the app playback is ready to go when the intent is handled).

## Demo: ControlAudio

ControlAudio is a demo app introduced last year that the team has updated to support this year's new feature, download it [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/media/managing_audio_with_sirikit).
