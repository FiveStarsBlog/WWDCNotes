The subscriber states has changed from
- Inactive
- Active 

to 
- Inactive
- Billing Retry
- Billing Grace Period
- Active 

which makes the subscriber journey more complex.

And we have some additional considerations to make such as:
- Upgrade, downgrade, or cross grade events
- Subscription Offer opportunities
- Billing retry and grace period messaging
- Refunds
