## Tracking Symptoms

30 Symptoms data types have been added to Health Kit this year, they are shown below.

![][symptoms]

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

ECG samples can now be read as an [`HKElectrocardiogram`][hkElectroDoc]. `HKElectrocardiogram` represents a collecton of voltage measurements. The class contains the following properties:

- [`classification`][classDoc] - can report if the user is in [Atrial fibrillation][afWiki] or not.
- [`symptonStatus`][syDoc] - is one of the tracking symptoms mentioned above.
- [`averageHeartRate`][avgDoc]
- [`samplingFrequency`][samplDoc]
- [`numberOfVoltageMeasurements`][voltDoc] - is the number of measurements that make up an ECG measurement.

If you want individual measurements you have to run the [`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`][queryDoc]:

```swift
// Query 
class HKElectrocardiogramQuery: HKQuery {
	public enum Result { 
    case measurement(HKElectrocardiogram.VoltageMeasurement)
    case error(Error)
    case done 
  }
  
  public convenience init(
  	_ ecg: HKElectrocardiogram, 
  	dataHandler: @escaping (HKElectrocardiogramQuery, HKElectrocardiogramQuery.Result) -> Void
  )
} 
```

## Mobility

6 minute walk test, stair ascent and descent speed, walking speed and step length can now be measured by your phone and/or watch. Walking speed and step length are captured by the walking asymmetry and double support percentage
