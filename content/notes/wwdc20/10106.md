## Writing experience

- You can write directly on a text field without the need to select the field first.
- You can draw a horizontal line to select text and perform the normal text editing actions.
- You can also scratch out some text that you want to delete.

## Scribble Supporting APIs

- Scribble relies on standard Text controls/inputs (`UITextField`, `UITextView`, ...)
- Scribble does not support passoword fields (because Apple's recommended way to input password is via autofill)
- for custom UI elements Scribble relies on UIKit's text input protocols ([`UITextInput`][UITextInput], [`UIKeyInput`][UIKeyInput], [`UITextInputTraits`][UITextInputTraits], [`UITextInteraction`][UITextInteraction])

## New APIs

Scribble introduces two interactions, [`UIScribbleInteraction`][UIScribbleInteraction] and [`UIIndirectScribbleInteraction`][UIIndirectScribbleInteraction], which are used to customize the behavior of Scribble in your app.

Both interactions are added to views where the custom behaviour takes place.

### UIScribbleInteraction

The interaction has a delegate, and this delegate is where an app can customize the Scribble experience, for example:

- disabling Scribble on the view
- delaying that view from becoming first responder until handwriting has momentarily paused
- being informed when Scribble handwriting begins or ends

### UIIndirectScribbleInteraction

Thanks to this interaction:

- we can allow writing outside a input control.
- this is also the interaction to use for UI that would become editable in response to a tap gesture.

This is done via the interaction's delegate. Which will provide the system information about elements, aka regions within the view that can be written into.
