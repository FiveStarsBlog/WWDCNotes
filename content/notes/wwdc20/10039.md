For document based apps, use the [`DocumentGroup`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/documentgroup) scene as the main scene of the app:

```swift
DocumentGroup(newDocument: MyDocument()) { file in
  ContentView(document: file.$document)
}
```

The content view receives a binding to the document contents, so when it changes the contents, the system knows it was modified

Document based apps have a “Document Types” section in the `Info.plist`, where you declare Uniform Type Identifiers of document types associated with your app:

- Imported types ⭢ documents from other apps or sources that your app is able to open
- Exported types ⭢ document types owned by your app

[`TextEditor()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/texteditor) - built in text view type

The type that implements the document model conforms to [`FileDocument`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/filedocument) (for value types) and declares its own [`UTType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uniformtypeidentifiers/uttype) instances that represent imported and exported file types:

```swift
import UniformTypeIdentifiers

extension UTType {
    static var exampleText: UTType {
        UTType(importedAs: "com.example.plain-text")
    }

    static let shapeEditDocument =
        UTType(exportedAs: "com.example.ShapeEdit.shapes")
}
```

Imported type needs to be a computed property, because the value returned from the constructor may change between calls while the app is running, depending on system configuration. Exported type can just be assigned once and stored.

The document type provides a list of types (own and generic) that it can accept:

```swift
static var readableContentTypes: [UTType] { [.exampleText] }
```

It also has methods for reading and writing its document to/from a file, which you need to implement, using e.g. Codable to encode/decode the value into your chosen format:

```swift
init(fileWrapper: FileWrapper, contentType: UTType) throws { ... }

func write(to fileWrapper: inout FileWrapper, contentType: UTType) throws { ... }
```

In those methods, you can assume that the content type is one of those you declared as accepted by your app.
