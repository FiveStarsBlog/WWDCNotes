## How to get started

- [researchandcare.org][researchandcare.org]
- [github.com/ResearchKit][github.com/ResearchKit]

## Onboarding updates

- ResearchKit comes in with a baked-in onboarding screen ([`ORKInstructionStep`][ORKInstructionStep]) ready to be used in an app:
  - we can customize thing such as image, title
  - can have multiple steps
  - a webview step ([`ORKWebViewStep`][ORKWebViewStep]) can now have an in-line signature section after the webview content
  - new request permission step to request user for authorizations to system features (`ORKRequestPermissionStep`)

## Survey enhancements

- now ResearchKit uses in-line labels to display errors instead of alerts 
- we can now enable a "I Don't Know" button to let users skip an answer if they don't want to answer a question (the `I don't know` text can be customized)
- new `ReviewViewController` that allows participants to view a breakdown of all the questions they were asked and the response they gave (users will be able to edit their answers from there as well)

## Active tasks

- many UI and UX improvements around hearing tasks.

## 3D models

- Two new classes to visualize 3D models:
 - `ORK3DModelStep`
 - `ORKUSDZModelManager`

How-to:

1. Add a USDZ model into the project
2. Create a `ORKUSDZModelManager` instance
3. Create a `ORK3DModelStep` and present it
