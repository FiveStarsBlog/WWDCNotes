## Timelines

- Representation of your complication's data over time
- Enables ClockKit to query your app once and get all information needed
- Extend or invalidate as necessary to ask ClockKit to re-query your app

- Your complication will show an entry until the date of the next one

## Complication building blocks

- There are dozens of [watchOS families][families]
- Ideally you will want to support as many complication families as you can
- For each family there are multiple [templates][families]
- All templates inherit from [`CLKComplicationTemplate`][CLKComplicationTemplate]

## Providing data

- When providing a timeline, we're giving WatchKit a list of [`CLKComplicationTimelineEntry`][CLKComplicationTimelineEntry] instances.
- These will populate your complications
- Each entry represents what your complications should look like at a certain point in time. 
- Each entry has two properties:
  - date, which is the date that this entry should be visible
  - complication template, which is the template containing the data you want to display for this entry
- Your main interaction with ClockKit is through an object you create that conforms to [`CLKComplicationDatasource`][CLKComplicationDatasource]. 
- There's only one required method in this protocol:

```swift
class ComplicationController: NSObject, CLKComplicationDataSource {
    func getCurrentTimelineEntry(
        for complication: CLKComplication, 
        withHandler handler: @escaping (CLKComplicationTimelineEntry?) -> Void) {
        // Call the handler with the current timeline entry
        handler(createTimelineEntry(forComplication: complication, date: Date()))
    }
}
```

- This function is used to get the current entry only, if we can/want to provide future entries as well, we will need to implement the following methods as well:

```swift
extension ComplicationController {

    // Specifies how far in the future you can provide entries 
    func getTimelineEndDate(
        for complication: CLKComplication, 
        withHandler handler: @escaping (Date?) -> Void) {
        handler(timeline(for: complication)?.endDate)
    }

    // lets you provide as many entries as is appropriate up to the limit after the given date
    func getTimelineEntries(
        for complication: CLKComplication, 
        after date: Date, 
        limit: Int, 
        withHandler handler: @escaping ([CLKComplicationTimelineEntry]?) -> Void) {
       handler(timeline(for: complication)?.entries(after: date, limit: limit))
    }
}
```

### Reloading complications

- call [`reloadTimeline(for:)`][reloadTimeline(for:)] on the `.sharedInstance()` [`CLKComplicationServer`][CLKComplicationServer] to invalidate the current timeline (and trigger an update session to reload it)
- call [`extendTimeline(for:)`][extendTimeline(for:)] on the `.sharedInstance()` [`CLKComplicationServer`][CLKComplicationServer] to let ClockKit know we can now provide more entries

### Data Providers

- provided by ClockKit to adapt the display of the same data/values in different templates or families of complications. 
- [`CLKDateTextProvider`][CLKDateTextProvider] will take care of displaying a date for you

```swift
let longDate: Date = DateComponents(year: 2020, month: 9, day: 23).date ?? Date()
let units: NSCalendar.Unit = [.weekday, .month, .day]
let textProvider = CLKDateTextProvider(date: longDate, units: units)
```

- [`CLKRelativeDateTextProvider`][CLKRelativeDateTextProvider] will take care of displaying relative time/intervals

```swift
let timerStart: Date = â€¦
let units: NSCalendar.Unit = [.hour, .minute, .second]
let textProvider = CLKRelativeDateTextProvider(date: timerStart, style: .timer, units: units)
```

- and [many others][dataProv] including image and gauge providers

## Multiple complications

- new in WatchOS 7
- declared via our [`CLKComplicationDatasource`][CLKComplicationDatasource] implementation via [`getComplicationDescriptors(handler:)`][getComplicationDescriptors(handler:)]
- we will use a [`CLKComplicationDescriptor`][CLKComplicationDescriptor] to define each complication
- if you want to update the complications your app offer, call [`reloadComplicationDescriptors()`][reloadComplicationDescriptors()]  on the `.sharedInstance()` [`CLKComplicationServer`][CLKComplicationServer] 
- note that if you remove support for a complication that is currently on a user watch face, WatchKit will continue to ask you for timeline entries for that complication

## Getting information back to your app

- tapping a complication launches your app
- based on the `CLKComplicationDescriptor` description define above, the app will be launched with:
  - a `userActivity` 
  - a `userInfo` dictionary
- either way, WatchKit will pass more data in the `userInfo` dictionary (passed also within the `userActivity`) such as the [`CLKLaunchedTimelineEntryDateKey`][CLKLaunchedTimelineEntryDateKey] and [`CLKLaunchedComplicationIdentifierKey`][CLKLaunchedComplicationIdentifierKey]
