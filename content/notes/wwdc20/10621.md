## Required device capabilities

- If your app requires a specific hardware capability (e.g. ARKit) then you should declare so via the [`UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`][UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities] property list key. 
- This prevent users from downloading apps that their device doesn't support.
- Youâ€™re allowed only to maintain or relax capability requirements. Submitting an update with added requirements is not allowed.
- For a complete list of capabilities and devices compatability, see [here][list].

### iphone-ipad-minimum-performance-a12

- For intensive apps there's a new `iphone-ipad-minimum-performance-a12` capability key that will allow apps to be downloaded only in devices with A12 or later hardware.
- This key has been created to support intensive and desktop-quality apps.
