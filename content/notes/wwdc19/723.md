New:

- A native diffing algorithm 
- A native way to compress `Data` (zlib and more)
- New Units:
  - `UnitDuration`: Added milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, and picoseconds
  - `UnitFrequency`: Added framesPerSecond
  - `UnitInformationStorage`: Bits, Bytes, and more

- `MeasurementFormatter` and `ByteCountFormatter` to display the new `UnitInformationStorage`
- `RelativeDateTimeFormatter`: “one hour ago”, “in two weeks” etc
- New `ListFormatter`

```swift
let string = ListFormatter.localizedString(byJoining: ["🐶","🐷","🦄"])

// en_US: "🐶, 🐷, and 🦄"
// es_ES: "🐶, 🐷 y 🦄"
// zh_TW: "🐶、🐷和🦄"
```

- GDC Improvement: barriers: in concurrent threads/environments we can now use a barrier, which makes sure that no other tasks can run while the barrier operation is ongoing.
