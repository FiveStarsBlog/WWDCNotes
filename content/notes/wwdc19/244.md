- **Dynamic Type**
  - make as much text as possible dynamic
  - use as much of the screen width as possible
  - don't truncate text
  - scale glyphs (icons/images) next to your text with your text
  - iOS provides 11 text styles
  - custom font support made easier in iOS 11

- **Reduce Motion**
  - adapt animations if `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled == true` (there is a notification too)
  - consider disabling autoplaying videos if `UIAccessibility.isVideoAutoplayEnabled == false` (there is a notification too)

- **Differentiate Without Color** is new in iOS13
  - do not rely on color alone
  - add additional indicators (icons) where color is the only way to convey information if `UIAccessibility.shouldDifferentiateWithoutColor == true` (there is a notification too)
