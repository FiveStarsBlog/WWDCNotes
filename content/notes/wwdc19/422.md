## Pro-tip to boost test setup

- Add `IS_UNIT_TESTING` environment variable
- Ensure only unneeded functionality is skipped for unit testing

```swift
func application(
	_ application: UIApplication, 
	didFinishLaunchingWithOptions opts: ...
) -> Bool {
	let isUnitTesting = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["IS_UNIT_TESTING"] == "YES" 
	if !isUnitTesting { 
		// Do UI-related setup, which can be skipped when testing
	}
	return true 
}
```
