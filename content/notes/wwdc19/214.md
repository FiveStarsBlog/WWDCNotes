- As long as we stick with default UIKit we should get much of Dark Mode for free.
- No more static colors: with Xcode 11 Apple is introducing semantic colors like label, secondaryLabel, link, and more. These will change based on the dark/light appearance.
- `UIControls` and pretty much everything in `UIKit` adapts correctly to the current interface (as long as we didn’t override things)
- `UIVisualEffectView` get the same treatments, instead of the static .light, .dark, .ultralight effects now we have dynamic .thin/medium/thick materials.
- We can still use vibrancy as before, and it will look great as before.
- For custom colors we should use the assets catalog, where for each color we can define a default and dark appearance. Same for images.
- For other custom things, we must listen to trait changes:

```swift
override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) { 
	super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)

	if traitCollection.hasDifferentColorAppearance(comparedTo: previousTraitCollection) {
		// Resolve dynamic colors again 
	}
}
```

- Use glyphs (template images) as much as possible, the work great in both light and dark mode.
