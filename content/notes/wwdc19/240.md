- SwiftUI is a common toolkit to learn once and use on all platforms (macOS, iOS / iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS)
- Cross-platform common elements like the `Toggle Cnotrol`, `Picker Control` and the whole `Layout System`

- **One size doesn't fit all devices**
  - But: "Learn once, apply anywhere" - base principle of SwiftUI
  - Use appropriate design patterns for each screen size (e.g. `List` on iPhone `UICollectionView` on iPad)
  - We still have to build 4 apps - for each platform

- **SwiftUI on Apple TV**
  - Carefully cosider what's appropriate to show on a big screen in the living room
  - Entire interface must support the tvOS feature `focus` which is supported by many SwiftUI elements, e.g. List
  - Elements have commands like `.focusable { isFocused in /* focus changed */ }`, `.onPlayPauseCommand { /* play/pause button pressed */ }`, `.onExitCommand { /* menu button pressed */ }`
  - iOS > tvOS adoption Demo at [15:20](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/240/?time=920)

- **SwiftUI on Mac**
  - Great device to provide more information (e.g. text)
  - SwiftUI auto-adapts spacing and padding
  - Access small- and mini-size controls using `.controlSize()` modifier
  - Consider proper support of multiple windows if users of your app may want to:
    - Compare content across windows side-by-side
    - Focus on a single item in its own window
    - Spatially organize windows around Desktop and Spaces

- 
  - Support keyboard shortcuts

- 
  - **Touch Bar**
    - SwiftUI makes it easier than ever to support this element
    - Just call the `.touchbar()` modifier of a view with a `TouchBar {}` parameter and fill the closure with one or multiple `Button` controls

- **SwiftUI on Apple Watch**
  - The watch is all about showing the right information at the right time
  - The most critical action of your app should be available within 2-3 taps
  - `.digitalCrownRotation` API to control crown rotation and haptics
  - Use `ScrollView`, `List`, `HStack`, `VStack` to group and layout your app
  - Use `.listStyle(.carousel)` when you have a few cell count or cells with interactive controls
