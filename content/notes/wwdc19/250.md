Custom actions help remove clutter in your app.

If we have a table with multiple cells and each cell has multiple buttons, by default voiceover will read each button for each cell.

Voiceover should only focus on the cell content, and provide custom actions instead.

Old way:

```swift
override var accessibilityCustomActions: [UIAccessibilityCustomAction]? { 
	get {
		let myAction = UIAccessibilityCustomAction(
			name: "Custom Action",
			target: self,
			selector: #selector(handleAction(_:)
		) 
		return [myAction] 
	}
	set {}
}

@objc func handleAction(_ action: UIAccessibilityCustomAction) -> Bool {
	var success = false 
	// action logic 
	return success
}
```

New way:

```swift
override var accessibilityCustomActions: [UIAccessibilityCustomAction]? { 
	get {
		let actions = [UIAccessibilityCustomAction]() 
    let myAction = UIAccessibilityCustomAction(name: "Custom Action") { 
    	(customAction: UIAccessibilityCustomAction) -> Bool in 
    	var success = false // action logic return success
    } 
    actions.append(myAction) return actions
  } 
  set {} 
}
```
