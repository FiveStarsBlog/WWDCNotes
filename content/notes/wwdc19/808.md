## Dark Mode

- all apps should support Dark Mode
- adopt iOS design system to `maintain familarity`, `provide platform consistency`, `convey clear information hierarchy`
- always use semantic colors like `backgroundColor`, `highlightColor`, ... instead of `red`, `green`, ...
- color hierarchy: Title > Subtitle > Placeholder > Disabled Text
- color hierarchy naming: `background`, `secondaryBackground`, `tertiaryBackground`, `quaternaryBackground`, ...
- `don't just use color inversion` between light/dark mode 
- `avoid alpha values` since it might look broken when different colors overlap
- check colors with `online contrast calculator` should give 4.5...1 or higher
- `layered interfaces` should use drop shadow in light / elevated bg color in dark mode
- all controls are drawn with semantic colors - perfectly blend between light/dark

## Card Style modal presentation style

- default - opt-out by `viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen`
- pull-down to dismiss (can be prevented when there is a mandatory decision in the modal)
- **Modals are for switching modes. Don't use them because you like the animation**

## Contextual Menus

- activate by tap & hold
- puts the focus on actions not on the preview (like peek & pop)
- available on any device since it doesn't rely on force touch
- consist on a list of actions and an optional previews
- all actions should be available somewhere else in the UI. Don't rely on the fact that users discover your menu.
