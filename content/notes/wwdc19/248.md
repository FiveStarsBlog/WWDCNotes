- For custom views set `isAccessibilityElement = true`

- **Enable Accessible Text Content** by adopting `UIAccessibilityReadingContent`
  - In `accessibilityLineNumber(for point: CGPoint) -> Int` use hit testing to identify subviews
  - In `accessibilityContent(forLineNumber: Int) -> String?` return the `accessibilityLabel` for the subview matching line number
  - In `accessibilityFrame(forLineNumber: Int) -> CGRect` return the `accessibilityFrame` for the subview matching line number
  - In `accessibilityPageContent() -> String?` return the concatenated accessibility labels for all subviews

- Enable **Automatic Page Turn** by
  - setting `view.accessibilityTraits = UIAccessibilityTraits.causePageTurn` on your page view
  - implementing `accessibilityScroll(_ direction: UIAccessibilityScrollDirection) -> Bool` (lets voice over turn pages)

- **Customizing Speech** by adopting the protocol `UIAccessibilityReadingContent`
