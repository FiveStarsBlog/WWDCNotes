- **Distributable** via
  - App on App Store (show up immediately in Safari)
  - App on your web site after running through the notarization service (show up in Safari after first launch of the app)

- **Unsigned Extensions** must be allowed each time Safari is run from the Developer menu
- **ContentBlocker** can now tell Safari App Extensions bout its activity
- **Page Navigation Delegate** informs about navigating/redirect to new site
- Adopting ContentBlocker and PageNavigation extensions allows 
  - replacing arbitrary content on websites
  - updating toolbar icon badge, e.g. with content items blocked count
  - blocking certain content from web sites you browse on

- **Screenshots** of web sites are now possible
- **Tab, Window, Page management**
  - Get base URI from native code without injection of script
  - Directly navigate to certain tabs without scripting from the extension
  - All open tabs and windows are visible from an extension

- **Popovers** can be shown/dismissed programmatically
- **Communication between App and Extension**
  - Possible by NSXPCConnection (extension and app must be part of the same app group)
  - Share data by using `UserDefaults(suiteName:)`
  - Sending messages from app >>> extension: `SFSafariApplication.dispatchMessage` 
  - Receive message in extension by implementing `SFSafariExtensionHandling.messageReceivedFromContainingApp` (Possible also when safari is not running - launched eventually)
