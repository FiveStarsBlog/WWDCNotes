## What's new with Wallet

- mass deletion interface for your passes
- lighter color scheme
- from iOS 11, only encrypted NFC passes are supported. Register yours at [developer.apple.com/apple-pay](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/)

### Opt-out of sharing

- Passes can now be opted-out of sharing
- Useful for single-use items, like loyalty cards or tickets

To take advantage of this, set the new top-level `sharingProhibited` key with value `true` in your `pass.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "sharingProhibited": true,
  ...
}
```

- Note: users can still share the pass in older versions of iOS.
