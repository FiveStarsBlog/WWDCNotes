## What is Time Profiling?

Samples stack trace information at prescribed intervals, providing an idea of how much time each method takes.

## When use Time Profiler?

- Frame rate slowdowns
- Some part of your app takes too long
- **Keep an eye on CPU usage in Xcode**

- Threads strategy: enable record waiting threads to expose blocked threads

## Ignore unwanted data

- Charge moves the associated cost
- Prune removes the associated cost
- Focus is "Prune everything but"
