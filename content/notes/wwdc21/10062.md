## SwiftUI app key principles

- Flexible
- Familiar
- Expansive
- Precise

## Takeaways

- You can set a `.frame(minWidth:)` view modifier to a sidebar to declare its minimum width
- When you have visual elements to show:
  - if you don't need complex sorting, use `List`
  - if you need complex sorting and/or multiple columns, use `Table`
    - when making a Table sortable, we need to pass a `sortOrder` binding

- [`focusedSceneValue(_:_:)`][focusedSceneValue(_:_:)] tells the system to expose the given value when the entire system is in focus
