- Text controls in the system are based on TextKit 1
- Started in OpenStep even before first version of Mac OS
- TextKit 2 is built on forward-looking design principles, used on macOS since v11
- TextKit 2 will coexist with TextKit 1 (for now), many new classes added, some updated
- Principles designed by:
    - Correctness: abstract away glyph handling
    - Safety: heavier focus on value semantics
    - Performance: viewport-based layout and rendering
- Glyph: Visual representation of a variable number of characters, e.g. Ã± is 2 glyphs
- Ligature: Single glyph representing multiple characters
- Glyph ranges were impossible to use right in many languages, TextKit 2 simplifies it
- In TextKit 2 all text is rendered with CoreText, no glyph ranges needed, higher level objects like `NSTextSelection`, `NSTextSelectionNavigation`
- Contributor comment: *didn't continue watching from here as too low-level/irrelevant for me*
