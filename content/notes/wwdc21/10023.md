- Focus is the system that lets your app take input from keyboards, remotes, game controllers, accessible switch controls, and other sources that -- unlike touch inputs -- are not tied to specific screen coordinates
- the focus view is often drawn with special embellishments, making it easy for people to predict where their input will be directed

## Focus state API

- new [`@FocusState`][@FocusState] property wrapper, which controls the placement of the app focus
- new [`focused(_:)`][focused(_:)] and [`focused(_:equals:)`][focused(_:equals:)] view modifiers, which bind the view focus state to the given state value

```swift
struct LoginForm {
  enum Field: Hashable {
    case username
    case password
  }

  @State private var username = ""
  @State private var password = ""
  @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

  var body: some View {
    Form {
      TextField("Username", text: $username)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .username)

      SecureField("Password", text: $password)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .password)

      Button("Sign In", action: onSignInTap)
    }
  }

  /// Puts the focus on one of the text fields if their data is missing.
  func onSignInTap() {
    if username.isEmpty {
      focusedField = .username
    } else if password.isEmpty {
      focusedField = .password
    } else {
      handleLogin(username, password)
    }
  }
}
```

- Note that the FocusState value is optional (`Field?` in the example): `nil` is used for cases where focus is in an unrelated part of the screen.

## Focus sections

- `FocusState`s are not just for text fields, but can also be used to navigate the focus of the app (think browsing tvOS)
- new `focusSection()` view modifier, which tells SwiftUi that this view is capable of accepting focus if it contains any focusable subviews
- this is used (in tvOS) to navigate between different/separate focus sections of the screen

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      VStack) {
         ...
      }
      .focusSection()

      VStack {
        ...
      }
      .focusSection()
    }
  }
}
```
