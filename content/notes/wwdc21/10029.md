## New Safari design

### Toolbar

- new browsing experience where the website content extends to the whole browser window
- the toolbar/interface is on one line, with elements auto showing/hiding
- the toolbar updates the background color based on the current website
  - to provide the toolbar color, add `<meta name="theme-color" content="blue">` in your website header (supports both dark and light mode)
  - you can also define it in a web manifest file
  - if you provide both, the HTML head takes priority
  - if no color is provided, Safari matches the web page background or header background color
  - Safari will adjust the color when it would affect readability or make Safari's UI elements inaccessible
  - can be changed via JavaScript

### Tabs Groups

- new way to organize tabs into group
- syncs across devices
- the toolbar can get easily filled with tabs: 
  - specify a high-res favicon for your website
  - make sure your website content title comes before the website name in the website `<title>` tag

### iOS navigation

- the toolbar a floating pill at the bottom of the screen
- when scrolling it minimizes itself
- similar to iOS's Home Indicator:
  - you can swipe left/right to jump across open websites
  - swipe up to see a grid of all the tabs and to access Tab Groups

- use CSS environment variables to deal with the new toolbar position via `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`
  - for example `padding-bottom: calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom));`
  - there are four environment variables that provide a measurement from the edge of the safe area to the edge of the viewport (`-bottom`, `-top`, `-left`, `-right`)

## What's new in CSS

- `aspect-ratio`
  - new CSS property that allows you to set a preferred aspect ratio for any element
  - if the content exceeds the available space in the preferred aspect ratio, the element grows to be taller
  - use `min-height: 0` to enforce your ratio to be always obeyed (and use `overflow: scroll` for example)

- `flex-gaps`
  - gives you a way to define a minimum space between items to make sure that thereâ€™s always a gap in Flexbox containers
  - from Safari 14.1

  - Scroll Margin
  - Web Animations on all Pseudo-Elements
  - LCH Color
