## Grid overlays

## Breakpoint enhancements

Five different breakpoints:

- Debugger breakpoints - for statements, exceptions, and assertions
- JavaScript breakpoints
- Event breakpoints - for events like click, timeouts, intervals
- DOM breakpoints - triggered when actions related to a DOM node occur
- URL breakpoints - triggered when a network request is about to be made for a URL via APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch

Enhancements:

- conditions and actions expressions now support Web Inspector’s Console tab API
- action types that support JavaScript expressions can be set to emulate a user gesture
- all JavaScript breakpoint options are now available to all other breakpoint kinds

## Audit authoring

What is Audit authoring?

- each test in the Audit tab is written in JavaScript and is run against the inspected web page
- These tests can check for incorrect DOM structure, help enforce design system rules, or help make sure you haven’t missed accessibility attributes
- usually tests are written else where and imported/exported in Web Inspector

Enhancements:

- new Audit edit mode - ability to create and edit your tests in Web Inspector
- the default Demo Audit and Accessibility tests cannot be edited (but can be cloned and then edited)
