- 3 page types that can be shown by DocC Catalog
- Reference: descriptions, code snippets, relationships
- Articles: free form content, give a big picture, explain specific tasks
- Tutorials: step-by-step walkthrough, beginner-friendly format
- This session focuses on articles, see other sessions for other page types
- Top level articles consist of summary, overview and topics section
- For article, a project with documentation catalog is needed
- Create catalog via new "Documentation Catalog" template (similar to asset catalog)
- Articles are written using Markdown, have `## Overview` and `## Topics` configured
- Image best practices to use `@2x` PNG files, add also `~dark` variant (if needed)
- Assets can be added to `Resources` folder of the catalog, include via `![title](x.png)`
- Top level article is named the same as the Framework, convention name `GettingStarted`
- For Topics, group types into groups, sort them from easy to complex
- In Topics, use the group name (e.g. `Essentials`) as the `###` title
- Link other pages via `- <doc:GettingStarted>` or `- ``TypeName```
- Any page can have a `Topics` section, recommended for top level article
- For documentation extensions, create a new `.md` file, leave primary content in code
- The topics section can be moved to the extension markdown file (named like type)
- DocC will merge together Swift original code file & "documentation extension" file
- Convention to put all documentation extension files to a `Extensions` folder
- The title of a documentation extension needs to be `# ``Framework/Type```
- Documentation can be exported so browsing in Xcode without package possible
- Extra session for uploading to Web, which is also possible
