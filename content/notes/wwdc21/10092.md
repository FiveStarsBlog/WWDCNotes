  - how to:
    1. zip the `PkPass` files together
    2. set the file extension to `.pkpasses`
    3. use the correct mime type `Mime Type: application/vnd.apple.pkpasses`

- Automatic hiding of expired passes
  - Wallet looks at three `pass.json` fields to determine if a pass should be automatically hidden:
    1. `expirationDate`
    2. `relevantDate`
    3. `voided`
