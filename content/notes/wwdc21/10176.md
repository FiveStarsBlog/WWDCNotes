- New [`searchable(...)`][searchable(_:text:placement:)] view modifier
- available on all platforms
- places the search field following each platform convention (you don't need to worry about, mostly)

Example:

```swift
NavigationView {
  WeatherList(text: $text) {
    ForEach(data) { item in
      WeatherCell(item)
    }
  }
}
.searchable(text: $text)
```

- `searchable(...)` takes the configured search field and passes that down, through the environment, for other views to use in the best way for each platform
- if no (sub)views use the configured search field, the `searchable(...)` provides a default implementation of rendering the search field in the toolbar

- `searchable(...)` sets up a new `isSearching` environment property, that you can use to dynamically change the view being displayed, based on whether a user is actively searching for example:

```swift
struct WeatherList: View {
  @Binding var text: String
  
  @Environment(\.isSearching) private var isSearching: Bool
  
  var body: some View {
    WeatherCitiesList()
      .overlay {
        if isSearching && !text.isEmpty {
          WeatherSearchResults()
        }
      }
  }
}
```

- some `searchable(...)` overloads also accept a `suggestions` parameter, which is a view builder that produces content that populates a list of suggestions
- SwiftUI looks at this `suggestions` view builder and will present it based on whether there are any suggestions to display

```swift
struct ColorsContentView: View {
  @State var text = ""
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      Sidebar()
      DetailView()
    }
    .searchable(text: $text) {
       ForEach(suggestions) { suggestion in
        ColorsSuggestionLabel(suggestion)
          .searchCompletion(suggestion.text)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- [`searchCompletion(_:)`][searchCompletion(_:)] replaced the need for you to wrap each suggestion with a button that replaces your `$text` binding
- use [`onSubmit(of:_:)`][onsubmit(of:_:)] to get notified when the user hits return from the search field

```swift
ContentView()
  .searchable(text: $text) {
    MySearchSuggestions()
  }
  .onSubmit(of: .search) {
    fetchResults()
  }
```
