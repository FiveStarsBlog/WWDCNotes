## Declaring a localizable string

- Use SwiftUI's `LocalizedStringKey` initializers, e.g. `Text("Hello world")`
- via variables, e.g. `button.title = NSLocalizedString("Order", comment: "…")`
- new Swifty way: `button.title = String(localized: "Order")`

Example:

```swift
let count = 3

// SwiftUI
Button("Order \(count) Tickets") { … }

// Swift
button.title = String(localized: "Order \(count) Tickets")
// This was previously obtained via .localizedStringWithFormat()
```

- Do not use `String(format: "Order %d Tickets", count)`, it's not intended for localization.

## Comment recommendations

Tips for a good localized string comment:

- declared the interface element (e.g. `button`)
- define the context
- explain each variable

Examples:

```swift
Text("Order", comment: "Button: confirms concert tickets booking")
Text("\(ticketCount) Ordered", comment: "Order summary: total number of tickets ordered")
```

## Tables

- localized strings can be further organized in tables
- by default all strings are put in a table named `Localizable`, which means all strings are stored in a `Localizable.strings` and `Localizable.stringsdict` file

Which means that the following example will search for the localization in `fr.lproj/UserProfile.strings` for the French translation (for example)

```swift
Text(
  "\(ticketCount) Ordered",
  tableName: "UserProfile",
  comment: "Profile subtitle: total number of tickets ordered"
)
```

## Bundle

- This parameter lets you load strings across targets
- `.main` by default
- if your app extension wants to use:
  - the same localizations as your app, there's nothing else to do
  - its own localizations, it needs to set `.module` as the `bundle` parameter value
- if the localization is vended by a framework you'd use:

```swift
/// In the framework

public enum OrderStatus {
  case pending, processing, complete, canceled, invalid(Error)

  var displayName: String {
    switch self {
      case .complete: return String(
        localized: "Complete",
        bundle: Bundle(for: AnyClassInTicketKit.self),
        comment: "Standalone ticket status: order finalized"
      )
      ...
          
/// In the app:

Text(OrderStatus.complete.displayName)
```
