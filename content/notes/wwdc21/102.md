## [Xcode Cloud][xc]

- CI/CD service built into Xcode and designed for Apple developers, runs on the cloud
- Everything can be done within Xcode UI, no context switching. 
- Integrates with any git host provider (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Setup CI/CD in 1 minute
- Configuration centralized in the cloud
- Flexible and extensible
- Each Xcode Cloud workflow configuration can be accessed through:
	- Xcode UI
	- App Store Connect web UI
	- App Store Connect public REST API (in JSON)

- Automatically handles code signing, app distribution and other workflows
- Review workflow results directly in Xcode
- Can automatically trigger workflows via PR creation, tags, and more
- We can choose environment's Xcode version, simulators (or just use Xcode Cloud's “recommended” ones), including targeting iOS beta releases (even when you’re using an earlier version of  Xcode)
- Helps testing more thoroughly on all platforms and in parallel
- Can notify back once the flow has finished (E.g. on slack)
- Can run scripts

Pricing:

- Free limited beta (sign up [here][xcb])
- More on pricing/availability this fall

## Code signing in the Cloud

- No more keeping and update certification and provisioning profile in your machine
- More insight of test flight beta testers
- Crash logs from test flight testers is automatically delivered in Xcode Organizer within minutes, can contact the tester directly from Organizer crash logs.

## Embedded Xcode GitFlow

Xcode has a new `Source Control Changes` tab, for better `git` integration:
- Shows all branches
- Shows all PRs
    - PR comments Integration directly in Xcode
    - Full overview of activities and conversations going on on each 
    - Live status on all workflows
    - Shows comments in line in the code editor
- In-line comparison and side-by side 

## Xcode Testing enhancements

When running UI tests, we can now see all screenshots in a gallery-like mode instead of having to click through each test step ourselves.
To enable it, go `Editor results menu > Gallery View` (instead of the default list view)

![][galleryView]

Run test repeatedly:
- We can run a single test multiple times automatically, this is great to check when a test is unreliable 
- New [`XCTExpectFailure`][XCTExpectFailure] API. This command declares a test is unreliable: the test suite will pass even when this specific test fails, in the results there will be a reminder about this test failing.

## New Xcode 13 features highlights

- Memory Tracking in XCTest 
- watchOS Digital Crown Interaction Tests 
- Smarter Swift Code Completion
- iPadOS Cursor Interaction Tests
- VIM Key Bindings
- Streamlined Project Navigator
- Faster Swift Builds 
- Swift Documentation Compiler
- Improved Swift Syntax Coloring
- Project Content for Swift Playgrounds
- Simplified Project Templates 
- Mac Scroll Performance Testing
- Swift Package Manager Index 
- Columnar Breakpoints
- SwiftUl Preview Rotations
- Layered Symbols 

## Swift concurrency

Swift first class support for concurrency

The `async`-`await` pattern replaces previous completion handlers pattern, we go from:

```swift
func prepareForShow(completion: @escaping (Result<Scene, Error>) -> Void) { 
	danceCompany.warmUp(duration: .minutes (45)) { result in 
		switch result { 
      case .success (let dancers): 
				self.crew.fetchStageScenery { scenery in 
					self.setStage(with: scenery) { openingScene in 
						dancers.moveToPosition(in: openingScene) { result in 
							completion(result)
						}
					}
				} 
			case .failure(let error): 
			  completion(.failure (error))
		}
	} 
}
```

to:

```swift
func prepareForShow() async throws -> Scene { 
	let dancers = try await danceCompany.warmUp (duration: .minutes (45))
	let scenery = await crew.fetchStageScenery() 
	let openingScene = setStage(with: scenery)
	return try await dancers.moveToPosition (in: openingScene)  
}
```

All iOS SDKs automatically adopt async-await.

### Structured Concurrency

- Concurrent child tasks
- Async let to create child tasks that run in parallel with the parent

In the previous example `scenery` had to wait for `let dancers = ...` to finish first, however it doesn't have to:

```swift
func prepareForShow() async throws -> Scene { 
	async let dancers = danceCompany.warmUp(duration: .minutes (45)) 
	async let scenery = crew.fetchStageScenery()
	let openingScene = setStage(with: await scenery)
	return try await dancers. moveToPosition(in: openingScene) 
}
```

### Actors

- Objects that protect their own state by providing mutual exclusive access to it
- Compiler will assures that async stuff is safely accessed
- Automatically avoid race conditions
- No need manually sync operations within actors

We go from:

```swift
class StageManager {
	var stage: Stage 
  let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "stage") 

  func setStage(with scenery: Scenery, completion: @escaping (Scene) -> Void) { 
  	queue.async {
      self.stage.backdrop = scenery.backdrop 
      for prop in scenery.props { 
      	self.stage.addProp(prop)
    	}
    	completion(self.stage. currentScene) 
    }
  }
}
```

to:

```swift
actor StageManager {
	var stage: Stage 

  func setStage(with scenery: Scenery) -> Scene {
  	stage.backdrop = scenery.backdrop 
  	for prop in scenery.props { 
  		stage.addProp(prop)
		} 
		return stage.currentScene 
	}
}
```

- Actors are defined via the `actor` keyword (see above)
- they're first-class constructs
- no need manual sync

- internally actors can access their states no problem, externally we use `await`:

```swift
let scene = await stateManager.setStage(with scenery)
```

- use the `@MainActor` attribute to assures a certain function is always run in the main thread (no need for dispatch)

```swift
@MainActor
func display(scene: Scene)
```

## SwiftUI

- More system components use SwiftUI as well (e.g. Apple pay sheet).

- New api for `List`s:
  - `.swipeActions` 
  - `.refreshable` for pull to refresh
  - `.searchable` for adding search field, supports search suggestions

- `#if else` conditional statement in Swiftui
