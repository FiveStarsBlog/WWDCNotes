- Reinvent CI/CD workflow into Apple environment
- Old flow : Code -> Test -> Integrate -> Deliver -> Refine
![][oldFlowXcodeCloud]
- New Flow : Simplify things to remove friction and context switching. All workflow can be done inside Xcode Cloud
![][newFlowXcodeCloud]
- Able to integrate with any git provider
- Easy setup CI/CD in 1 minute
- Flexible and extensible, also has REST API for own use case
- Code signing, distribution and other workflow, Xcode handle it for us

- Xcode management available in browser and app of AppStore Connect
- Help Test more thoroughly of all platform all in parallel in all Test Plan
- New Gallery View : See all images in each test presented together
![][galleryView]
- Run repeatedly test : New feature for testing flaky test

## Swift Concurrency

- Modern, Safe, Fast concurrency API

### Async await
- Async : function
- Await: caller wait this operation to be done
- Avoid nested completion handlers

### Structured Concurrency
- Create concurrent task easily
![][async]

### Actors
- Ensuring safe-thread access between task
- Avoid race condition
- No need manually synchronous the operation inside
- combine it with async await for guarantee mutual exclusion
- @MainActor: API run in main thread
- Effective optimization, reducing reference count, inlining, excessive context switches
![][actor]
