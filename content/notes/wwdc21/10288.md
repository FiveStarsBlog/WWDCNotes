## Overview

- create your own libraries by dragging SF Symbols in your library names in your `Library` section in the sidebar
- you can also select and drag multiple symbols at once
- selecting any symbol will bring up the `information inspector` which:
  - tells us OS availability/deprecation
  - shows its current and previous names
  - previews symbol variants and localization
    - all these variants are automatically handled by the system
    - it's possible to specify a particular localization in Xcode using suffixes like `.ar` (for Arabic) or `.zh` (for Chinese)

- beside the `information inspector` we also have the `rendering inspector`, which allows us to preview each symbols in various rendering (monochrome, hierarchical, palette, multicolor)

## How to create a custom symbol

1. pick one symbol to dupliace
2. `File > Duplicate as Custom Symbol`
3. Export the `.svg` template file and change it in your design app
4. drag the updated `.svg` template into the app and the new symbol will be available

- SF Symbols app now supports copying images of symbols to place in your software
  1. pick your symbol rendering
  2. `Edit > Copy Image` (or press Option-Command-C)
  3. paste in your software

- You can also choose `Edit > Copy Image As...` to control:
  - the format of the copied image (either PNG or SVG format)
  - point size
  - pixel scale
  - these settings above will be preserved until you change them again

- use the `Export Symbol...`  for transferring custom symbols into Xcode
