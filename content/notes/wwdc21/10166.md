- 3 ways to build documentation:
    - Menu: “Build Documentation” on demand

    - `xcodebuild docbuild` for the command line (e.g. on CI)
- Xcode supports opening the DocC Archive in a nice GUI with navigation & search (called Documentation Viewer)
- Documentation is written in-source, via `///` doc domments
- DocC only generates documentation for code marked as `public` or `open`
