- Screen Time allows: monitor time, set limits, share usage with family, limit communication
- API available on iOS & iPadOS (not on Mac this year)
- Guiding Principles of API:
    - Provide modern API for existing restrictions
    - Protect user privacy (e.g. no way to access websites / apps for Apple / 3rd parties)
    - Enable new parental control experiences by 3rd parties

- Manage Settings (Restrictions): Direct access to same restrictions available in Screen Time
    - locking accounts, prevent password change, filter web traffic, shield apps and websites

- Family Controls (Authorization): Drives family policy
- Device Activity (Usage): Giving abilities to run code without launching app
- Manage settings restrictions:
- Family Controls prevents removal & circumvention, privacy preserving tokens for apps & websites
- Device activity "schedules": time windows that call an extension in your app at start & end
- Events: usage monitors that call extension when usage threshold is passed by user
- Terminology: "Guardian" and "Child", see "Homework" demo app code
- New "Family Controls" capability to be added in Xcode
- `AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization` to ask for permission
- Guardian will need to authenticate on the child's phone, only works on child phones
- Once user authorized, no sign out of iCloud possible by child
- Subclass of `DeviceActivityMonitor` with overriding `intervalDidStart` and `DidEnd`
- Schedule via `DeviceActivitySchedule(intervalStart:intervalEnd:repeats:)`
- `DeviceActivityCenter().startMonitoring(.daily, during: schedule)` to monitor
- Use `Button.familyActivityPicker` to show app picker (provided by system)
- A lot of more restrictions available, such as media rating
- Use `DeviceActivityEvent` API on the center to react on app time limit events
- Shields (screen that shows restriction reached) can be customized by:
    - Material, Title, Icon, Body, Button 1 & Button 2

- Subclass `ShieldConfigurationProvider` and override `configuration(for:)`
- Returns an object that has exactly all the above mentioned customization possibilities
- Use `ShieldActionHandler` for the primary & secondary buttons to decide  what to do
    - `.close` or `.defer`, use `defer` e.g. when waiting for Guardian action to disable
