- New quick authorization button:
  - [`CLLocationButton`][CLLocationButton] for UIKit
  - [`LocationButton`][LocationButton] for SwiftUI

- these buttons give your app Allow-Once authorization, without prompting user authorization every time it's tapped
- available on watchOS, iOS, macOS with Catalyst, and iPad apps on Mac

## Customization

### (UIKit) CLLocationButton

This is a UIButton with customizable parameters:

- `CLLocationButtonIcon` to set the type of the arrow
- `CLLocationLabel` to set the label of the button
- `cornerRadius` to set the roundness of the button
- `fontSize` to set the size of the label

### (SwiftUI) LocationButton

```swift
LocationButton(.currentLocation) { 
  // do something on button press...
}
.foregroundColor(.white)
.cornerRadius(15.0)
.labelStyle(.titleAndIcon)
.symbolVariant(.fill)
.tint(.blue)
```

### Warning

Note that not all customization are possible, Xcode will warn you with log messages when the minimum requirements are not met, for example:

```lldb
#locationButton rendering failed due to inappropriate sizes 
#locationButton rendering failed due to Insufficient Alpha
#locationButton rendering failed due to contrastRatio between tintColor and backgroundColor insufficient 
```

## Prompt

- If your app already have any kind of location authorization, then the button will work right away
- If your app doesn't have any permission yet, tapping the location button will trigger a one-time prompt (which won't be shown again when tapped again), see below
- this same prompt is shown if the user previously denied your app location permission access
