- Text in columns
- Text wrapping (see butterfly in session below)
- Rich Text editing (attributed strings)
- Interactive text coloring (while typing)
- Text folding (show/hide paragraphs without changing the body text)

- Custom truncation
![][truncationImage]

- So..looks like many things that we can achieve twisting the `UIFont` actually should be done via `UIFontDescriptor`. Such as

- Exclusion Paths
![][exclusionPathImage]
Note that the exclusionPaths can be changed in real time!
Look at what this guy does at 26mins and 50 seconds! (itâ€™s a fixed `bezierPath` of the butterfly shape, that moves according to the pan gesture)

- Links: We can turn any arbitrary text range into a link (both logically and visually) now using `NSLink` attribute: obviously you will also need to pass the URL.

- [Data Detectors][dataDetect]: We can use data detectors to detect locations, URLs, dates and more in arbitrary text.
This can be even done automatically in a storyboard ðŸ¤£

- Text Attachments: Used usually for inline images, attachments live inside of the `NSTextStorage`.
Attachments change the geometry that the layout manager uses to flow text into.
![][attachmentImage]
If the user long press into the attachment, it will be prompted to save the attachment (in the camera roll for example)

- Delegation: We can decide which text is interactive by being the textViewDelegate and expose the `shoudInteractWithâ€¦` function.
This way we can also change the default iOS interaction with something custom for our app.

## UITextView Composition
_See session [220][220] for an introduction regarding the three TextKit classes._

![][compositionImage]

- The first thing you're going to see when you pull apart a `UITextView` is the `NSTextContainer` instance.
- `NSTextContainer` is giving the `NSLayoutManager` the bounds, the geometry to render the text into.
- And `NSLayoutManager` is taking all of the text from your `NSTextStorage` and turning it into lines of glyphs inside of your `TextView`.
